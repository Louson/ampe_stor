Driver for Alcor Micro PCI-Express card reader
plus concerning gentoo ebuild to build the kernel module...

 - works at least - not very stable - with my gentoo-sources-4.12.6 kernel
 - up to now several hangups / ro-remounts during copy actions from my 64GB sdcard (vfat) to harddisk 
(don't try to repair the sdcard file system in case the systems tells you that the file system of sdcard is corrupt... then it's really corrupt)
